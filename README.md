Brief History:
The Philippine Military Academy(PMA) is the premier military academy for Filipinos aspiring for a commission as a military officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).It was established on December 21, 1936, by the virtue of National Defense Act of 1935. It is patterned after the United States Military Academy, in West Point, New York.The academy is located in the city of Baguio, and serves as the primary training school for future officers of the AFP.

The academy traces its roots to 1898, when Emilio Aguinaldo decreed the establishment of the Academia Militar in the Philippines. The present academy serves as a national historical landmark for historic contribution and its “long and unending line of quality military education.” The campus is a popular tourist destination in Baguio.

Cadet candidates for admission must undergo and pass series of testing (Written, Physical, Medical and Neuro-Psychiatric); around 400 men and women enter the academy each June. Students are officers-in-training and referred to as "cadets" or collectively as the "Cadet Corps Armed Forces of the Philippines" (CCAFP). Tuition and monthly allowances are fully funded by the government in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation.

The academic program grants a Bachelor of Science in National Security Management with a curriculum that maintains a high level standard of cadet's performance in academics, military tactics and sports & physical fitness. Cadets are required to conform with the Honor Code which states that "We, the cadets, do not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate among us those who do." PMA bases cadet's development in four aspects: character, academics, military and physical. Graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants in the Philippine Army and Philippine Air Force and as ensigns in the Philippine Navy.

Despite the limited baccalaureate offered, the academy consistently places in the top 100 Universities and Colleges in Philippines for its quality education and management. PMA is ISO 9001:2015 certified.

Cadet Life:
Fourth class Cadets are the first year students. In the academy, they are called **"plebes"** and are the equivalent of the college freshmen in civilian universities. The first day of plebe hood starts with the Reception Ceremonies on June 1 of each year. Then, they undergo an eight-week summer training or "beast barracks" during which time they are indoctrinated with the military and cadet systems of training. During this period, the plebes form the New Cadet Battalion and their training is handled by the tactical officers and upper-class cadets forming the "Plebe Detail." After the beast barracks, the plebes are formally accepted into the ranks of the Cadet Corps in another ceremony called Incorporation which is held during the last week of July.

Third class Cadets are the sophomores in civilian universities, and are referred to as **"yearlings"** in the academy. Upon completion of fourth class year, the yearling adjusts to life as an upper class cadet. Although they are the least ranking of the upper class cadets, they are now entitled to the privileges of being upper class cadets. One of their responsibilities is being a "buddy" to a plebe. As buddies, they set the examples of how a cadet should behave and they are responsible for ensuring that the plebes conform with the standards of cadet ship.

Second class Cadets are also called the **"cows"**. The second class year marks the point at which the cadet starts to specialize according to the branch of service he or she has elected to join upon graduation. Thus, the second class cadets may no longer take the same subjects as that of some of his or her classmates. They now take different subjects depending on their choice of branch of service after graduation and fields of specialization. Within the cadet chain of command, the second class cadets now act as squad leaders. Moreover, in the absence of the first class cadets, they take over the responsibility of running the Cadet Corps.

First class Cadets, also known as **"firsties"**, are the ruling class and as such they occupy the major positions of responsibility in the cadet chain of command. They are designated the chairmen and cadet-in-charge of the various committees, clubs and corps squads. They also enjoy certain privileges peculiar only to the "firsties". Their academics are also more specialized as they now embark on the final year of their training for future officership in the Armed Forces of the Philippines. These cadets receive their military officership commissions and academic degrees equivalent to degrees from civilian universities in May every year.
